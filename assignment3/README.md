# Assignment 3

We'll implement CNN, first as numpy, then as PyTorch.

Before the assignment:
- start `download_data.sh`to load data.
- Load all libraries `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Part 1
Convolutional Neural Network

`CNN.ipynb` - follow the instructions in python notebook.

## Part 2
PyTorch CNN

You need the access to GPU.

It could be GPU от NVidia on your PC, then PyTorch with GPU support through Conda - https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

If you don't have GPU, you can use Google Colab(https://colab.research.google.com/), free access to GPU in the cloud.

(You don't need to install Keras, our notebook will install PyTorch)

`PyTorch_CNN.ipynb` - follow the instructions in python notebook.
